               <p>Do you remember your own school days? Chances are it isnâ€™t the science equipment or the playground that first comes to mind. It will be your favourite teacher. Perhaps because they were one of the first adults to really understand you. Or because they made learning seem so easy. Whatever the reason we know great teachers inspire great students.</p>
               <p>Thatâ€™s why at GEMS Education, we pay close attention to how we train and support both our new and experienced educators. We know just how rewarding a teaching career can be, when teachers have the right support and opportunities to develop.</p>
               <h5 class="text-primary my-5">So, what makes a great GEMS teacher?</h5>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>GEMS Quality Standards</strong>â€“ High quality teachers all creating educational excellence</li>
                  <li><strong>The Right Tools</strong>â€“ A world of resources and tools at their fingertips</li>
                  <li><strong>Career Pathways</strong>â€“ Rewarding opportunities that can take our teachers anywhere</li>
                  <li><strong>Pioneering People</strong>â€“ Engaged teaching professionals with new ideas and knowledge</li>
               </ul>
               <p>When you come in to any one of our schools, we are sure youâ€™ll be welcomed by our great teachers.</p>
               <p>With over 20,000 teachers, leaders and education specialists from more than 115 countries, the GEMS Education team is a group of diverse, talented and passionate educators.</p>
               <p>Regardless of where our teachers come from, they are all education professionals, who know better than most that you never stop learning. Every GEMS teacher has access to the GEMS Professional Development programme, and over 150 events and workshops each year â€“ keeping their teaching practices cutting-edge, connected to their colleagues and highly effective in the classroom.</p>
               <p>As you start to get to know our teachers, theyâ€™ll want to get to know you and your family. We believe that close parent-teacher relationships are essential to helping students achieve their individual best. Thatâ€™s why GEMS Schools strongly provide parent resources and promote programmes which encourage parental involvement.</p>
               <h4 class="text-primary py-4">GEMS Principals</h4>
               <p>GEMS principals are responsible for ensuring these world class expertise reach children in the classroom. Our principals shape the direction of GEMS schools, establishing their culture, their ethos and their direction.</p>
               <p>Above all, GEMS principals are there to inspire and to motivate, giving teachers the support and confidence they need to be the very best educators and motivating students to achieve their full potential â€“ with the full support of GEMS parents.</p>
               <p>Our principals have an exceptional track record, focusing on outstanding results, happy teachers, successful students and involved parents.</p>
               <h4 class="text-primary py-4">Inspecting quality</h4>
               <p>We may be passionate about constant improvement and innovation in teaching, but weâ€™re also serious about maintaining our high standards in every single GEMS school. The standard of our teaching is regularly assessed by a team of more than 150 senior academics who have been trained in important areas of school inspection including:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>International accreditation</li>
                  <li>School inspection methodologies</li>
